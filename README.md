# Davies_Bouldin_Index_KMeans
This repository contains a naive implementation of Davies Bouldin Index used to find the optimum number of clusters in K-Means clustering. It is a measure of computing the quality of clustering that has been performed. 

The Davies Bouldin Index has to be calculated for any value of n_clusters (nc) as follows:
